--------------------------------------------------
This project utilizes javax.swing.* as the GUI to display a simple calendar program for users.

--------------------------------------------------
HOW IT WORKS:
1. Run the program, a screen will be displayed with the question asking if you have an account or not; if you click on "YES", you will be directed to the log-in screen where you can log in with username as "user" and password as "password"; if you click on "NO", you will be directed to a "New Feature is Coming" screen showing a message that you can create an account in phase 2, with a possible extension featured designed in the Menus.java class;

2. Proceed after logging in with the correct credentials, you will be directed to the main menu where you can select different options including Create Event, Show Event, Show Memos and Show Alerts, under different screens you will see different options and functions that are required in phase 1;

3. If you want to proceed to other functions, please re-run the program for it to run; extension feature for a GoBack button has been implemented for phase 2 where you will be able to go back on a previous menu.
